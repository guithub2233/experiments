Compile:
  javac -cp ../../ruby/jruby-netty/netty-3.2.4.Final.jar:. SimpleClient.java     

Run:
  java -cp ../../ruby/jruby-netty/netty-3.2.4.Final.jar:. SimpleClient

Receiver:
  nc -6l 8080  | dd of=/dev/null

Issue:

  I can't seem to exceed ~1.5MB/sec writing.

Reproducing it:

  Run the 'run' and 'receiver' above, after about 30 seconds, kill the java one.
  You'll see 'dd' output the rates, something like this:
