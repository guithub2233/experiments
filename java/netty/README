Compile:
  javac -cp ../../ruby/jruby-netty/netty-3.2.4.Final.jar:. SimpleClient.java     

Run:
  java -cp ../../ruby/jruby-netty/netty-3.2.4.Final.jar:. SimpleClient

Receiver:
  nc -6l 8080  | dd of=/dev/null

Issue:

After around 1MB written, it stalls and channel.isWritable() always returns true.
Even if I skip the 'isWritable' check, it always stalls out.

Output:
