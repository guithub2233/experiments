# Cisco ASA Grok patterns

Based on the html in this page:
  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa80/system/message/logmsgs.html

The `cisco.rb` script generates the [output.txt](output.txt) patterns that might be usable in grok.

This is a work in progress. The 'logmsgs' docs for Cisco has fairly
inconsistent html patterns across all the error message examples, so the
patterns generated may not be 100% perfect.
