This is an experiment to try and make Noah a bit more general purpose.

I want to be able to specify my own schema in Noah because the current host/etc
stuff doesn't align with what I need to do.

It should be possible to specify your own set of models that noah can use and
provide a REST interface for.

Links and watchers *must* continue working.
